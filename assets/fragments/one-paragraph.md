For full-stack web developers who struggle to build correct and glitch-free applications, Missionary is a reactive programming toolkit based on process supervision, that lets you build massively concurrent, fine-grained reactive systems on both frontend and backend. Unlike promises and go-routines that make it easy to write a broken program, Missionaryâ€™s combinators provide the right set of constraints to let you build a fully composable program that is also correct and bug-free.
