# `missionary.core/?`

## Usage
* `(? task)`

The asynchronous parking [synchronizer](/synchronizers.html). A `task` process is spawned and its result is returned
when it completes. If the process crashes, the error is rethrown.

Example : synchronize on task completion
```clojure
(require '[missionary.core :as m])

(m/? (m/sleep 1000 :foo))
:= :foo
```

Example : recover from task failure
```clojure
(require '[missionary.core :as m])
(import 'java.io.IOException)

(try (m/? (m/via m/blk (slurp "https://clojur.org")))
     (catch IOException _
       :io-failure))
:= :io-failure
```

## Synchronicity
* `task` spawn is synchronous with parking call
* parking return is synchronous with `task` completion
